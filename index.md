# Welcome to my page!

Hello! I am Andrew Choi and I am currently a freshman studying Environmental Science at Lehigh University.

## About me

I have always been interested in computers but I am using this sort of programming software for the first time. I enjoy 3D modeling using CAD software, something I was interested in since high school. Whether they were designs for levers, pulleys, or gears I could connect to make a working machine, 3D modeling taught me that anything I could think of was a possibility.

I joined the journalism class to further my interests in data gathering, organizing, and planning using statistics and analysis. Many of the classes I am taking this first semester cover the interests I have had since high school but not been able to actually pursue, and I plan to have a set major by the beginning of my sophomore year at Lehigh.

## Lehigh Undergraduate Student Enrollment

> The infographic below displays the relationships between the number of students enrolled in each of the different colleges at Lehigh University. It should be noted that the most amount of students are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences, due to the vast variety of subjects that the college gives students. The rest of the population is split between the other colleges, giving Lehigh the capability of teaching a whole plethora of topics. In addition, Lehigh also offers certain programs that mix the interests of two or more different subjects, and although not as popular as the other subjects, offer yet more learning opportunities.

## Infographic Project 1

> The infographic below described the energy consumption of the United States compared to the world in 2019, as well as the percentage of energy types within the United States itself. I created the infographic mainly to show how much energy the United States and the top 10 energy-using countries use as a whole, compared to everyone else in the world. The results were shocking, and it gave me an idea of exactly how much energy we are using, while not realizing that we only make up a small percentage of the worldâ€™s population. In addition, I included energy types and their respective percentages in order to demonstrate where our country is likely going in the future, and how such trends could have a major impact.
