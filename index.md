# ENGL 002 Multimodal Project
## Andrew Choi, Prof. Provost, 5/10/21
## The Energy Crisis, Visualized


> For this semester's multimodal project, I decided to create a website that could help me convey the ideas I expressed in my essay with a visual format. I separated the topics I am talking about into four distinct sections, explained through graphs and visuals about energy and its applications. I also created a table of contents to help viewers travel to the different sections faster, as seen below:

## Go to topic:

[US Energy Production](#us-energy-production)

[Energy Outlook](#energy-outlook)

[Global Energy Production](#global-energy-production)

[Energy Consumption](#energy-consumption)


## US Energy Production

> This section will focus on the development of United States energy production in terms of energy type. This data varies widely across sources, but there is a clear trend both from the past and the present that we can use to determine the role of the United States in relation to the world. The information will also give us a good idea of what we should expect from renewable energy based off of what we already know.

> The graph above gives us a good history of how energy was developing from its origins. Even before the rise of nonrenewable energy, there was a presence of renewable energy in the 1800s, likely as an effort of developing energy that was able to sustain historic societies without the pressure of high global energy demands we are facing today. This trend was broken when societies discovered energy far more effecient, but renewable energy is once again on the rise due to the harmful effects nonrenewable energy has caused in recent years.

> The graph above shows us the general capacity of different types of energy as of recent years. Capacity refers to the maximum amount of energy that is able to be produced from any given source under optimal conditions. While the overall capacity of nonrenewable energy is more than that of renewables, the difference is minimal, especially with the capacity of geothermal energy. This form of energy has the highest capacity rating of any form of energy, which is why renewable energy is not only sustainable but also nearly as effective as current sources, which will only benefit us in the future.

## Energy Outlook

> This section will focus on the outlook of energy we can expect to see, now that we know what the energy trends were in the past. Along with observing the differences between energy in different areas of the world, we can use this data to predict how each area will develop under both individual conditions, and outside sources such as the effects of COVID-19.

> The infographic above highlights global access to electricity, or how much electricity is distributed towards various areas of the world. It should be noted that the amount of energy a country receives and the amount of energy a country uses is very different, describing that country's overall energy contribution. In general, certain areas in Africa and East Asia are the most severely affected by energy distribution, but other areas such as South America or Central Asia have adequate access to energy despite the fact that many areas in those regions are also struck with extreme poverty.

[the conversation](https://theconversation.com/covid-19-will-slow-the-global-shift-to-renewable-energy-but-cant-stop-it-133499)

> The graphic above describes the forecast of US energy production past 2020, and how COVID-19 affected the distribution of energy compared to the past few years. While the changes are not great, we can see a clear decrease in coal and natural gas sources as well as a clear increase in nuclear and renewable sources. Notice the steady increase in nonrenewable sources over the past decade being abruptly halted in 2020 due to the severe impact on the energy market from the effects of reduced trade worldwide. A more passive event would have led to a plateau in nonrenewable energy usage instead of a sudden decrease.

[enerdata](https://www.enerdata.net/publications/energy-outlook-tool.html)

> This graph shows the intensity of carbon dioxide intensity of electricity generation over the next few decades, across multiple areas of the world. This value is set to decrease on average, and for most of the world, this decrease is projected to be so great it will have almost been halved by 2050. This is likely a consequence of the usage of more renewable energy sources and less energy sources creating atmospheric waste, which is a positive outlook since it means there will be less environmental damage, which is one of the major reasons why nonrenewable energy sources are unsustainable.

## Global Energy Production

> This section will go over the production of energy and energy resources worldwide, and how they affect our knowledge of energy distribution across different areas of the world. Energy resources play a large role in energy production because, in summary, we need resources to make more resources. Therefore, we will see how making what is needed for energy differs from making the energy itself.

[our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy#how-much-of-our-primary-energy-comes-from-renewables)

> The graph above shows the contributions of different countries towards renewable energy production. At first, it seems like certain countries simply produce more energy than others, but in reality, the countries that produce the most energy are using only a small portion of it, while countries that do not produce too much energy are using the large majority of it. This is most pronounced in areas of Africa, where a large portion of the energy is being produced, even though these nations do not have much access to the energy itself. This goes to show the extreme imbalance between energy production and distribution.

[energies nouvelles](https://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.com/article/cobalt-energy-transition-closer-look-supply-risks)

> The map above shows global cobalt production, which is a vital resource used in making various types of renewable energy. While some of these resources are coming from countries that actuall use them, such as the US, others are being produced in areas of extreme poverty, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. This area of Africa is lacking in energy access and usage, despite the fact that they have the resources to make it. Therefore, there must be some aspect of the country that is focused completely on energy production and nothing else, otherwise, the data would not be this skewed.

## Energy Consumption

> This section highlights the energy consumption between the US and the world, and how this data vastly differs from energy production and distribution. Through the infographics it is clearly shown that there are certain trends this energy usage seems to follow, such as the fact that certain forms of energy and certain uses of energy are applied in different ways, along with the fact that some countries use more energy than others.

[our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy#how-much-of-our-primary-energy-comes-from-renewables)

> This graph shows the general energy usage between the countries of the world, and when compared to how energy is produced and distributed between these areas, the results are shockingly different. Areas of poverty such as South America and Central Asia simply do not use as much energy as the United States, despite the fact that they have the same access to energy as almost every other area of the world. In addition, Central Africa uses arguably the least amount of energy as the rest of the world, even though they are the largest producers of some of the most vital resources they need.

> This infographic shows the usage of energy in terms of commercial use in detail. Right away, it is apparent that most commercial services are powered by sources unrelated to renewable energy, but that renewable energy still plays a large role in all services. Energy types such as biofuels and geothermal play different roles in providing energy to different services, but it is still large enough to be apparent and still have room to grow. In addition, energy consumption itself is also divided into different categories, with renewable energy playing the largest role in power, heating, and cooling.

> The map above shows the energy usage of each US state in relation to a country of the world. Immediately, it is apparent that the US uses more energy than any other country in the world, but how much more energy is really defined through this map. Each individual state uses at least as much energy as one whole country, with larger states such as Texas using as much energy as the entire country of Brazil, which in itself is almost as large as the United States. Other noteworthy mentions are Calefornia using as much as Mexico and New York using as much as Egypt, all of which are much smaller than their corresponding countries.

## Conclusion

> This website was produced with the purpose of portraying how severe and skewed the production, distribution, and consumption of energy is, was, and will be throughout this century. There have been countless examples of how energy is not being produced optimally or how certain countries should use less energy, and these ten examples are only a few out there. Sustainable energy is the optimal step we should be looking towards, as well as allowing all aspects of energy to balance between all countries of the world so that we can break free from the flawed system we rely on today. Whether the viewer be an energy producer or a common civilian, dedicate more time into making life more sustainable, and over enough time, we will change the world for the better.
