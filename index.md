# Welcome to my page!

Hello! I am Andrew Choi and I am currently a freshman studying Environmental Science at Lehigh University's Class of 2024.

## About me

I have always been interested in computers but I am using this sort of programming software for the first time. Speaking of computers, I enjoy 3D modeling using CAD software, which I have taken an interest in since high school. I have also been playing the clarinet for the past eight years, so I can say that is also something I enjoy doing. I joined the journalism class to further my interests in data gathering, organizing, and planning using statistics and analysis. Many of the classes I am taking this first semester cover the interests I have had since high school but not been able to actually pursue, and I plan to have a set major by the beginning of my sophomore year at Lehigh. 

Environmental Science is also something I have taken interest in since high school, thus why I am proposing it as my major coming into college. I have taken environmental science classes before in high school and it fit my previous interests of drawing maps and organizing data, so I thought it could be a viable major I could study in a professional environment. However, that is all subject to change as my interests are constantly changing. I even planned on being a computer science major during college but knew I had little experience on the subject, thus why I am surprised I am learning it now. So far, my website looks fairly generic, thus why I hope to customize it more to my liking in the future!
