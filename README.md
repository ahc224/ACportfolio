Hello! I am Andrew Choi and I am currently a freshman studying Environmental Science at Lehigh University.

## About me

I have always been interested in computers but I am using this sort of programming software for the first time. I enjoy 3D modeling using CAD software, something I was interested in since high school. Whether they were designs for levers, pulleys, or gears I could connect to make a working machine, 3D modeling taught me that anything I could think of was a possibility. 

I joined the journalism class to further my interests in data gathering, organizing, and planning using statistics and analysis. Many of the classes I am taking this first semester cover the interests I have had since high school but not been able to actually pursue, and I plan to have a set major by the beginning of my sophomore year at Lehigh.


## Lehigh Undergraduate Student Enrollment

> The infographic below displays the relationships between the number of students enrolled in each of the different colleges at Lehigh University. It should be noted that the most amount of students are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences, due to the vast variety of subjects that the college gives students. The rest of the population is split between the other colleges, giving Lehigh the capability of teaching a whole plethora of topics. In addition, Lehigh also offers certain programs that mix the interests of two or more different subjects, and although not as popular as the other subjects, offer yet more learning opportunities.

## Infographic Project 1

> The infographic below described the energy consumption of the United States compared to the world in 2019, as well as the percentage of energy types within the United States itself. I created the infographic mainly to show how much energy the United States and the top 10 energy-using countries use as a whole, compared to everyone else in the world. The results were shocking, and it gave me an idea of exactly how much energy we are using, while not realizing that we only make up a small percentage of the worldâ€™s population. In addition, I included energy types and their respective percentages in order to demonstrate where our country is likely going in the future, and how such trends could have a major impact.

## Timeline Project

> The timeline below describes the rivalry between Lehigh and Lafayette in football. This is a long-lasting rivalry that has been going on for many decades, and each event in history represents a turning point in this ongoing conflict. Even through the current pandemic, the timeline shows that the rivalry has not stopped.

## Timeline 1 (The Future of Space Travel)

> The timeline below is a representation of what space travel could look like in the next century and even beyond. Each moment in the near future is taken in intervals of 10 years, with the exception of the last one. This was done on purpose, to create an accurate scale showing just how far apart events in space can be. Some of these points are mere speculation, but could provide insight as to what the future of society could look like going forward.

## Chart Project

> The chart below describes the percentage of students that enrolled in Lehigh last year. Each bar is displayed in relation to all of the others, with each value displaying a percent of students that enrolled in that specific college.

## Chart 1, Revenue of Big Tech

> The chart below displays the evolution of total annual revenue per year from three different companies, all of which market, "big tech". It is fascinating to me how people evolve, and it is shown by what products they buy as time progresses. In 2010, sales in Sony topped Apple and Microsoft, but fell over time as the other two took over. However, as Apple and Microsoft developed similar products, Apple gained a vast lead and remained superior throughout the decade. By creating a bar chart that directly places these values up against one another, it is easy to see the difference between all three companies with ease. In addition, by having the same scale, this difference is much more pronounced than if I had a fluctuating scale or a break in the interval.

## Chart Project 2

> This chart displays the percentage of the ratio between three different schools over the course of five separate schools at Lehigh University. The percentages fluctuate constantly, so it is important to look at the statistics before making any decisions on what school is best for prospective students when applying to Lehigh University.

## Chart Project 3

> The chart below displays the relationship between a country's GDP and its happiness level. While there is no specific unit of happiness, the chart shows this relationship in comparison to their respective countries, based on their GDP. In this case, I created a scatter plot in order to show the distinct points in the data, since the trend is visible, but vague. In general, the higher the GDP of the country, the more happy it is, with happiness being based on its citizens. Due to Chartbuilder limitations, I could not show the names of the actual countries; however, this can be easily bypassed by searching each country's GDP.

## Chart 2, Subscriber Count

> The chart below describes the relationship between the subseriber counts of the two biggest Youtubers on Youtube. Youtube is a platform where creators can create whatever videos they want, and upload them with the world. To me, These two Youtubers who have culminated over 100 million subscribers as of January 2020 are the face of the platform, with some of the biggest fanbases in the world. In addition, I found it surprising that T-Series, a music channel based in India, started extremely small but grew to overtake even PewDiePie in only the past few years. To me, this shows the evolution of how society as a whole is evolving through separate interests, as even the smallest of creators can grow with enough time and effort. It should be noted that I did in fact create the last time stamp, January 2020, but Chartbuilder did not display this information on the actual graph.

## Map Project 

> The map below displays the top 20 cities that are the most popular for cycling. On a map format, it is easy for you to scroll through the various locations and find out exactly what city you should go to next for your next cycling trip. Although nowadays, it might be a better idea to stay home, since traveling is not the best idea. All information credited from Wired, 2019.
