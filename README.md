Hello! I am Andrew Choi and I am currently a freshman studying Environmental Science at Lehigh University's Class of 2024.

## About me

I have always been interested in computers but I am using this sort of programming software for the first time. Speaking of computers, I enjoy 3D modeling using CAD software, which I have taken an interest in since high school. I have also been playing the clarinet for the past eight years, so I can say that is also something I enjoy doing. I joined the journalism class to further my interests in data gathering, organizing, and planning using statistics and analysis. Many of the classes I am taking this first semester cover the interests I have had since high school but not been able to actually pursue, and I plan to have a set major by the beginning of my sophomore year at Lehigh. 

Environmental Science is also something I have taken interest in since high school, thus why I am proposing it as my major coming into college. I have taken environmental science classes before in high school and it fit my previous interests of drawing maps and organizing data, so I thought it could be a viable major I could study in a professional environment. However, that is all subject to change as my interests are constantly changing. I even planned on being a computer science major during college but knew I had little experience on the subject, thus why I am surprised I am learning it now. So far, my website looks fairly generic, thus why I hope to customize it more to my liking in the future!

## Lehigh Undergraduate Student Enrollment

<The infographic below displays the relationships between the number of students enrolled in each of the different colleges at Lehigh University. It should be noted that the most amount of students are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences, simply due to the vast variety of subjects that the college gives students. However the other colleges also seem to have a good percent of the population, making Lehigh as a whole a diverse school with the capability of teaching a whole plethora of topics. In addition, Lehigh also offers certain programs that mix the interests of two or more different subjects, and although not as popular as the other subjects, these programs offer a greater variety of learning opportunities that I think should be used more often.
